/*!
	This file contains the APIs for KSC(Kai's Shader Compiler).
	The primary goal of KSC is to provide the compilation and JIT support for HLSL-like language, 
	so that the hosting C++ application can compile the HLSL-like code on the fly and JIT the requested
	functions.
	The HLSL-like language, which KSC supports, is called KSCL. Its language spec is described in
	another document, however here in short you can assume it is a superset of C language with HLSL swizzling support.
	Several of vector types are native built-in types, such as float4, float3 and int4. Differing from C,
	the pointer type is not supported for safety reason(KSCL is a "safe" language, see more for this in KSCL sepc). 
	Passing-by-reference is supported and the JIT-ed function will treat the referenced arguments as C++ pointers, 
	thus it gives the ablity to modify the data from C++ side in KSCL-implemented functions.
	The KSC APIs are kept as simple as possible, you may refer to each API for the details.

	The type information retrieved KSC APIs.

	If the "type" is a structure, then the hStruct member will be set to non-zero, 
	which can be passed to APIs for other information.

	The "sizeOfType" takes the alignment requirement into account, which is platform-dependent
	as well as the "alignment".

	The "typeString" can be used to distinguish the actual external types so the hosting C++
	side can do actions based on it.

	The "isRef" flag indicates whether the function argument is passed by reference. In hosting C++ side,
	the passed-by-reference argument will be JIT-ed as pointer to the associated type. 

	The "isKSCLayout" flag indicates whether this function argument is depending on KSC internal implementation
	for different platforms. In hosting C++ side if this flag is set, passing the pointer of structure with the same declaration 
	as in KSCL code will not be guaranteed to work, unless the type alignment and the padding between structure members are respected.
	It is highly suggested to use the "KSC_AllocMemForType" API to allocate the KSC compatible memory layout of structure and use 
	"KSC_GetStructMemberPtr" and "KSC_SetStructMemberData" APIs to retrieve and modify the member data of KSC structures.
